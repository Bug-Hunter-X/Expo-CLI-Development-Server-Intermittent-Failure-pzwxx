The solution involved a multi-pronged approach: 

1. **Check for port conflicts:**  Identify if another application is using the port (usually 19000 or 19001) that Expo tries to use. If so, stop that application or change the port in your Expo project's configuration. 
2. **Clear the Expo cache:** Run `expo start --clear` to clear the cache, which could contain corrupted data. 
3. **Downgrade Expo CLI (if necessary):** If the issue persists, consider temporarily downgrading the Expo CLI version to a previous stable release to test if it resolves the problem.  Compare package.json to identify which version was running before the issue occurred.
4. **Check dependency versions:** Compare the package.json file from before the upgrade. Try downgrading certain packages if necessary to isolate the conflict. 

If the problem remains after these steps, provide the exact error message and your Expo CLI, React Native, and relevant dependency versions for more specific troubleshooting.
