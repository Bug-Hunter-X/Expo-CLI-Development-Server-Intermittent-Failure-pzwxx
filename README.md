# Expo CLI Development Server Intermittent Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI, where the development server would fail to start intermittently, displaying inconsistent error messages. The issue occurred after upgrading the Expo CLI to the latest version and installing a new dependency in a React Native project.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run `expo start`.
5. Observe that the development server may fail to start, displaying an inconsistent error message. This behavior is intermittent.

## Potential Causes

* **Expo CLI Version:** An incompatibility or bug in the latest Expo CLI version.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Conflicts between newly installed dependencies and existing packages.
* **Port Conflicts:** Another application might be using the port Expo CLI attempts to use.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves checking for port conflicts, clearing the Expo cache, and potentially downgrading the Expo CLI version if the problem persists. Refer to `expoBugSolution.js` for a more detailed approach.
